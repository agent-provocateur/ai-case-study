This my exploration of Midjourney, a lab and a open beta AI tool that generates visuals based on text prompts. In their words, they are "an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species. We are a small self-funded team focused on design, human infrastructure, and AI."
