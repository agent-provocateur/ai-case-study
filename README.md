## This my exploration of Midjourney, a lab and open beta AI tool that generates visuals based on text prompts

> In their words, "***Midjourney** is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human > species. We are a small self-funded team focused on design, human infrastructure, and AI.*"

Using the **[/imagine]** command and the prompt "indigeneous girl with black hair flowing in the air riding a fast running white wilde horse in front of a big oil refinery with white cloud of smoke coming out of a very tall smoke stack, black and white". I was able to generate the image above in less than a minute.

We'll get to the fascinating subject of the ownership of the image above at the end of the case study, keep reading.

### Company History

Midjourney was founded in in San Francisco, CA by David Holz and released the public beta in 2022. At the moment of writing, Midjourney has 1,373,836 users logged in on Discord and 20,417,250 members worldwide.

David Holz has degrees in Applied Math and Physics. He and a small group of brilliant minds have developed -in my humble opinion- the best image generator in the world based on diffusion models. Midjourney's main competitors are DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Bing Image Creator and Leonardo.ai amongst others.

Lastly, the issue everybody is talking about, ownership. 
Let's say that The Economist and The Atlantic have published images generated on Midjourney the very first year it was available. The fear is real regarding copyright issues. Enormous controversy around "fake" images and legal battles are the subject line of many feeds everday. T

Two important points need to be brought forward. One, Section 4 of Midjourney's Terms of Service states that "Midjourney subscibers own all the images they've created". And , yes there are some exceptions and takedown policy. Two, in 2023 an AI-powered content moderation system has been put in place starting with Midjourney's version 5.

### Conclusion

At this point everything is confusing for some and very clear for others but we are all learning a tremendous deal of new paradigms regardles of our backgrounds. Even Google, as a dominant player in the space, caution us all on "THE RISK OF OVER-RELIANCE" in a sponsored content paper on mainstream publications stating that "-the worry is that a similar erosion of foundational know-how could occur with AI."
On the other hand, Nicole Ingra, an owner of a marketing agency in Barcelona questions...
