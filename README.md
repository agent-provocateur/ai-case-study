## Midjourney: Generating astonishing visuals based on text prompts
<br>

>In their words, "***Midjourney** Midjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species. We are a small self-funded team focused on design, human infrastructure, and AI*"

Using the **[/imagine]** command and the prompt "*indigenous girl with black hair flowing in the air riding a fast running white wild horse in front of a big oil refinery with white cloud of smoke coming out of a very tall smoke stack, black and white*". I generated the image above using Midjourney in less than one minute.

We will get to the fascinating subject of the ownership of this image in moment…

### The company

Midjourney was founded in San Francisco, CA by David Holz and released its public beta in 2022. At the moment of this writing, Midjourney has 1,373,836 users logged in on Discord and 20,417,250 members worldwide.

David Holz has degrees in Applied Mathematics and Physics. He and a small group of brilliant minds have developed the best image generator in the world (in my humble opinion), which is based on diffusion models. Midjourney's main competitors are DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Bing Image Creator and Leonardo.ai, among others.

### New rules

An important issue is ownership of AI generated images. Respected publications, such as The Economist and The Atlantic, have published images that was generated with Midjourney, which brings up the question of who should be credited with these images. Normally, a photograph carries a copyright. However, if an image is AI generated, who owns it? There is enormous controversy around "fake" images and plenty of litigation on the subject.

Midjourney has addressed ownership as follows: Section 4 of Midjourney's Terms of Service states that, "Midjourney subscribers own all the images they've created." However, they also state that there are exceptions, and they have a channel in place to handle requests to “takedown” images that appear on their website or that have been generated using their software. Also, an AI-powered content moderation system has been put in place starting with Midjourney's version 5.

### Where do we stand?

Everything is confusing for some people and very clear for others, but we are all learning a tremendous number of new paradigms, regardless of our backgrounds. Even Google, as a dominant player in the AI space, recently sponsored content on mainstream media stating cautions on "THE RISK OF OVER-RELIANCE" and "the worry that erosion of foundational know-how could occur with AI."

From a different perspective, Nicole Ingra who owns a marketing agency in Barcelona, asks:

## <p style="text-align: center;"> "When I hear collagues being skeptical of AI, I ask them, 'Have you spent time larning the tools?'"</p>
